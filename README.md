This project consists of an online platform designed to manage clients, smart devices equipped with energy consumption sensors and monitored data from sensors. The system
can be accessed by two types of users after a login process: administrator, and clients. 
The administrator can perform CRUD operations on client accounts, registered smart devices that have sensors attach to monitor energy consumption, smart sensors attached to devices
and on the mapping of clients to devices  and sensors to devices.


Technologies used: 

 -REST services for backend application (Java Spring) 

 -JavaScript-based framework for client application(ReactJS)

Requirements:

 -Functional: Users log in, Administrator Role, Client Role

 -Non-Functional: Security(cookies, session, etc.)
